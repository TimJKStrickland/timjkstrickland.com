  <h2>How We Met</h2>
  <h3>04.7.16</h3>
  <p>We matched on Tinder and set out for our first date in San Francisco, California. Tim was very excited and assumed wrongly that Mari worked in SF just like he did or maybe lived there because she immediately responded with an "Ok!"</p>
  <p>He found out after they met up at a local coffee shop on Mission Street that she in fact did not live in San Francisco, but lived 45 minutes East, much closer to Tim and they both could have picked something much more comfortable and closer to home. Regardless they hit it off, and it was apparent that coffee wasn't going to be enough time for Tim to spend with Mari. So they went across the street to get some ice cream from Ghirardelli.</p>
  <p>This was first step into understanding Mari's sweet tooth. We spent the better part of 10 minutes choosing between the flavors and chatting about family (including Tim realizing that he spoke absolutely zero Spanish and could understand bupkus). The ice cream came and went, and it was clear that Mari was also not ready to say good-bye yet. So they decided to go to the interactive museum on wharf called the Exploratorium.</p>

  <h2>The Proposal</h2>
  <h3>10.28.18</h3>
  <p>
    In late July of 2018, Tim and Mari went on a trip to Europe where they traveled through Croatia and Italy. Through not so subtle hints, Tim was peppering Mari with questions anytime they passed some store resembling a jewelry store. He spent every waking moment trying to find the perfect location in Italy to propose. The vacation drew to a close leaving him ringless and frustrated.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once stateside, he immediately set to task of finding the perfect ring and the perfect location. With the help of her sister Anita, Tim finally found the perfect ring for Mari by the end of August.
  </p>
  <p>
    The location was more difficult. Tim planned a trip to Twin Peaks overlooking all of San Francisco at sunset, but as is typical for the area, the fog rolled bringing with it zero visibility and a wind-chill that dropped the cool 60 degrees to an uncomfortable cold.
  </p>
  <p>
    Next he planned a walk outside their home of Oakland to the Rose Garden. Unfortunately the walk began at sunset, and by the time they got to the beautiful park there was scarce light except for one street light. This of course prompted the immediate question from Mari, "What if we get murdered here?" Strike Two.
  </p>
  <p>
    In a last ditch effort, Tim tried to plan another walk in the middle of the day to one of the hills overlooking the East Bay, avoiding the what ifs and the fog. They took their time, enjoying the sun and the view. They got to the top of the hill only to realize that they were overlooking a memorial service at the cemetery below them. A beautiful sentiment for the family remembering their loved one, but not exactly the most romantic location.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tim spent the rest of that day in a sour mood. He kept thinking and racking his brain around where else would be good enough for Mari. He was so frustrated and distant, that when they were making dinner that night, Mari finally stopped him and said, "Look what's bothering you?" She was expecting him to break up with her, but he quickly explained in frustration that he had been trying to propose for weeks, ever since they were in Italy. He had been trying and trying to think of the perfect location, and ended up with the floor of the kitchen they shared in Oakland. As a period to his rant, he got down on one knee.
  </p>
  <p>She said yes, and that this was exactly the way she wanted the proposal. Simple, eloquent, and where we spend most of our time together at home.</p>
